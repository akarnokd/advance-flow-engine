Drastical refactoring of classes. The class names remained the same, but their location has changed.
This helps removing any package cyclic dependency and makes a more clear grouping of the code.

The SVN now contains a generated Javadoc of the Flow Engine.

All NetBeans and GWT related files have been removed and cleaned. Libraries are moved to the
/lib directory.
